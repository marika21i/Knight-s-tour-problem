# Knight's Tour problem 

It'a a Python implementations of some algorithms to find the solution for the Knight's Tour problem .
The problem is to find a sequence of moves of the knight on the chessboard such that the knight visits every square on the board exactly once. We decide to implement only algorithms that solve the problem with open tours, the knight does not end on the same cell it starts.

All the code with results and comment is in the Jupyter notebook file.
